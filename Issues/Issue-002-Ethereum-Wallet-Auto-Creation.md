## üéØ Objective
Guarantee that every user possesses an *Ethereum* embedded wallet **immediately after passkey login**, so that subsequent *Bitcoin* wallet creation never fails due to missing server-side prerequisites in Privy.

## üîß Implementation Details
1. **Automatic ETH-wallet provisioning**
   * Added `useEmbeddedEthereumWallet` & `getUserEmbeddedEthereumWallet` imports in `components/UserScreen.tsx`.
   * Introduced a `useEffect` that:
     1. Runs whenever the authenticated `user`, Ethereum wallet array or account ref change.
     2. If no ETH wallet is detected (`!ethAccount && ethWallets.length === 0`) it silently calls `create()`.
2. **Logging**
   * Basic `console.log` / `console.error` instrumentation for success & error paths.
3. **Branch & Merge Workflow**
   * Feature branch: `fix/eth-wallet-auto-create`.
   * Commit: `c8a9632 ‚Äì feat: auto-create Ethereum wallet on user login‚Ä¶`.
   * Merged to `main` via non-ff commit `64d71ef`.
4. **Tooling / CI**
   * Installed missing node-modules (`npm install`).
   * Installed `eas-cli@latest` globally and confirmed successful `eas build --platform ios --auto-submit --profile production --non-interactive`.

## üìù Changelog Extract
```
Added  Automatic Ethereum-wallet provisioning on login via useEffect in UserScreen.tsx
Changed UserScreen imports and React import to include new hooks & useEffect
Infrastructure Installed project dependencies and EAS CLI for successful TestFlight build
```

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- [x] On first login a user with no ETH wallet has one created automatically.
- [x] Bitcoin wallet creation no longer errors because of missing ETH wallet.
- [x] Feature passes TestFlight build and runtime smoke-test.
- [x] Code merged to `main` & pushed to GitHub.

## üü¢ Status
**Closed ‚Äî implemented & verified in v0.0.2-alpha**.

### Future Work / Notes
* Consider surfacing the console logs in a dedicated Debug UI for non-technical testers.
* Extend logging to cover Bitcoin wallet creation once that flow is re-enabled.
